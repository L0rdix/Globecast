# Globecast

Globecast is a little side project of mine in which i used the [Openweatermap API](https://openweathermap.org/) to get the current weather of a city.

## Use Case

Globecast can be used to get the temperature and the weather of a certain city or country and compare them with other locations.

## Live Site

You can access Globecast [here](https://l0rdix.github.io/Globecast/).
